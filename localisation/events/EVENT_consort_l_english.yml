 mod_consort.1.t:0 "An Offer of Marriage"
 mod_consort.1.da:0 "It is with some consternation that the mighty families of the realm have watched [Root.Monarch.GetName] letting the years pass [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] by without finding someone to marry. These feelings have now turned into open dismay as despite the realm lacking a clear line of succession our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] appears to have no plans to find a spouse nor is [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] showing much interest the proposals sent to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].\nIt has now reached the point where the court is expecting the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to accept one of the offers on the table. Continued failure to secure the succession puts the entire realm at risk. Luckily one of the oldest and most prestigious [origin_of_queens_family.GetName] families in the [Root.GovernmentName] has offered us the hand of one of their daughters, along with a generous dowry."
 mod_consort.1.db:0 "Ruling a great [Root.GovernmentName] can be busy work and [Root.Monarch.GetName] has never shied away from that challenge. As the years go by, however, it has become increasingly clear that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is not devoting the expected time and effort to find a new consort. While it is reasonable to expect a certain period of mourning that time is now long past.\nIt is high time [Root.Monarch.GetName] takes a new spouse. Luckily, when you are a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] the high ranking families of the realm are eager to lend a helping hand."
 mod_consort.1.dc:0 "The stability of a hereditary realm rests on having a clear succession. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] remains an unmarried [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan] despite having reached a marriageable age without a clear heir. Some of the finest families in our [Root.GovernmentName] would be overjoyed to help us in this matter and would likely be ready to pay an astronomical dowry for the privilege."
 mod_consort.1.dd:0 "To have a member of your family be the foremost consort of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is a great honor and one all the influential families of [Root.GetName] covets. In the hopes of securing a lasting alliance leading [origin_of_queens_family.GetName] landholders has sent an offer, and an astronomic dowry, asking that [Root.Monarch.GetName] take their daughters hand in marriage."
 mod_consort.1.a:0 "Accept the offer."

 mod_consort.2.d:0 "With the union of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Consort.GetName] we have gained not only a spouse but also a new ally in the realm. The [Root.Consort.Dynasty.GetName] is an old and influential family and their seat in [origin_of_queens_family.GetName] is a jewel of the [Root.GovernmentName].\nOf course friendship has to go both ways and [Root.Consort.GetName] will be expected to speak for [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] kin while our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will be expected consider such advice very carefully."

However apart from that role our [Root.Consort.GetTitle] is also a representative of the crown to the [Root.Consort.Dynasty.GetName] house and vice versa. At times this is not an arrangement without benefits.\nToday [Root.Consort.GetName] seems very pleased to announce that [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] family has decided to show its support for the throne and for the union of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Consort.GetName]."

Now that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is the Royal Regent of the realm they are ecstatic. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is now one of, if not the, most powerful [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan] in the realm and the family has made it very clear to us that they expect to be treated in accordance to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] position."
 mod_consort.5.a:0 "What kind of [Root.Monarch.GetDaughterSon] would [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] be if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] did not help?"

 mod_consort.6.d:0 "A royal marriage is rarely a matter of love. Rather, it is a diplomatic opportunity which is not to be wasted. It is also of great importance that the future consort is of suitable status and it is advantageous if she or he is a foreigner, so as not to disturb the balance of internal politics. \n\nHowever, even a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can become lovestruck. Then all such matters seem to melt away - from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] point of view, at least. A local from the [consort_home.GetName] province has caught [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s eye. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] appears to be happier than ever, entirely and endlessly enamored. While our nobles and advisors are less than pleased, the union between [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] beloved has strong support among the commoners of the realm."

However, rumors bringing these issues to light have recently begun to spread... Some say that the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] has refused to let go of [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] old [origin_country_of_consort.Religion.GetName] faith - while the people may have understood the need for a marriage with foreigners they are less likely to do so when it comes to being ruled by a heretic."

Considering that this is also the homeland of our [Root.Consort.GetTitle] it is no wonder that [Root.Consort.GetName] has been met with increasing animosity. For all they know [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] could be harboring loyalties towards the old country, or worse - [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] could be a spy! And is it not a funny coincidence, the nobles argue, that the great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has become so dependent on the advice of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spouse?\n\nOur military advisor $ARMY_ORGANISER$$ARMY_REFORMER$$COMMANDANT$$GRAND_CAPTAIN$$MASTER_RECRUITER$$MILITARY_ENGINEER$$QUARTERMASTER$ has gone so far as to threaten to leave court if the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] does not distance [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] from the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] and [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] untrustworthy whispers."
