 THE_RUKMARI_CRISIS_TITLE: "The Rukmari Crisis"
 THE_RUKMARI_CRISIS_DESC: "It has been over one thousand years since the collapse of the Ancient Rukmari Empire. Reckless overuse of magic by the Rukmari elves resulted in the near total destruction of the Rukmar continent. The elves, although much weakened, persevered and restored much of the Rukmari civilization over the ensuing millenia. With the re-discovery of the Sun Orb, the elves of Rukmar have once again begun to practise sun magic with the intent to use it to conquer all of Ixalor."
