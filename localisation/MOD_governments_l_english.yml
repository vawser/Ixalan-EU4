 mod_enforce_privileges_reform: "Strengthen Noble Privileges"
 mod_enforce_privileges_reform_desc: "The noble class has served our state well for generations and as it grows it is only fitting that we continue to confer great privileges to those families that have devoted themselves to our cause."
 
 mod_quash_noble_power_reform: "Curtail Noble Privileges"
 mod_quash_noble_power_reform_desc: "As the state grows it is becoming more and more apparent that the old noble families have too much influence and power. Their jealous concern for their old privileges is greatly hindering the growth of our government."
 
 mod_enforce_trader_privileges_reform: "Enforce Trader Privileges"
 mod_enforce_trader_privileges_reform: "By strengthening the ties between the state and successful merchant enterprises, we can increase our reach out into the world as well as the profit we bring home."
 
 mod_exotic_traders_reform: "Strengthen Distant Traders"
 mod_exotic_traders_reform_desc: "While distant kingdoms and its people are savvy to rich lands, the port has always attracted traders. This land was taken with sword in hand but ship owners and traders are as influential and as vital to our state as noble officers."
 
 mod_religious_syncretism_reform: "Religious Syncretism"
 mod_religious_syncretism_reform_desc: "The most popular disciples of our religion have always been the most accepting. They incorporate parts of the local traditions and take an active part in the daily life of the local population. Many of them have taken on the role of local leaders and, if we support them, we may see their communities grow as they reclaim land from jungles and swamps to build new cities."
 
 mod_hereditary_rule_reform: "Hereditary Rule"
 mod_hereditary_rule_reform_desc: "Our monarchy is hereditary, meaning the ruling dynasty is consistent throughout the years. This grants legitimacy to the state."
 
 mod_centralize_reform: "Centralized Bureaucracy"

 mod_local_recruitment: "Local Recruitment"
 mod_local_recruitment_desc: "Over time it has become evermore clear that we cannot trust either our conflict prone governors or the local land holders. If we are to acquire officials and commanders we can trust we must look to recruit local nobles to fill these positions instead."
 
 mod_clergy_in_administration_reform: "Administrative Clergy"
 mod_clergy_in_administration_reform_desc: "The clergy already possess many of the skills we look for in administrators. They are well educated, experienced scribes and they have a higher calling. In many ways allying ourselves with the clergy would offer an efficient and very strong cadre of administrators."
 
 mod_of_noble_bearing_reform: "Nobles of the Robe"
 mod_of_noble_bearing_reform_desc: "The noble families of the realm have sworn to provide not only council but also eternal loyalty to our monarch.

 mod_meritocratic_focus_reform: "Meritocratic Recruitment"
 mod_meritocratic_focus_reform_desc: "We cannot let old privileges govern who will get the privilege of serving our kingdom as it grows.

 mod_aristocratic_court_reform_desc: "The Nobility served us well over the centuries, and has become an integral part of our government.

 mod_states_general_reform_desc: "By a Union of States with representatives in the States General we can more easily deal with the pro-federal movements in our nation while retaining our Monarchy.\n\nThrough elections and events, the §YStatists§! and §YMonarchists§! will vie for control over the nation. The effects of this reform and the frequency of elections depend on which faction is currently in power."
 
 mod_general_estates_reform: "General Estates"
 mod_general_estates_reform_desc: "The ancient privileges of the estates must be respected and their role in legislation be strengthened. Let us regularly call the general estates as a way to guide and counsel our great ruler."

 mod_legislative_houses_reform_desc: "By separating the legislative body into more than one house we can better balance the need for change with the one to conserve and preserve the traditions of old."

 mod_nepotism_reform: "Political Dynasties"
 mod_nepotism_reform_desc: "In this country a number of families have over time emerged as very willing to assume the responsibilities of state. So much so that it has become both expected of them to shoulder that responsibility, and expected of the state to offer it to their scions."
 
 mod_republicanism_reform: "Republicanism"
 mod_republicanism_reform_desc: "This Republic has made itself a guardian of Republican ideals, citizen power and everyone working together for the common good."
 
 mod_frequent_elections_reform: "Frequent Elections"
 mod_frequent_elections_reform_desc: "Long terms make rulers reckless and the very idea that someone would rule for a long time is contrary to the very idea of a republic. Let us reform our election system to ensure better accountability from our elected officials."
 
 mod_consolidation_of_power_reform: "Consolidation of Power"
 mod_consolidation_of_power_reform_desc: "The current terms for officials are too short to see through larger projects. This only feeds populism and leads to short-sighted policies.

 mod_lottery_reform: "Sortition"
 mod_lottery_reform_desc: "Elections by majority votes are prone to corruption or worse, populism. We shall employ a complex system of allotment to determine who should lead our Republic by selecting almost at random from among a pool of suitable candidates."
 
 mod_provincial_governments_reform: "Provincial Governments"

 mod_presidential_reform: "Presidential System"
 mod_presidential_reform_desc: "The Chairman or President of our governing body must be elected separately from the legislative branch of government. The president can then appoint or dismiss members of the government."
 
 mod_republican_diplomacy_reform: "Republican Diplomacy"
 mod_republican_diplomacy_reform_desc: "Our city state cannot maintain its independence without the support of other republics. We shall focus our energies on strengthening our diplomatic ties and ensuring that, whenever we have need of them, our friends will be there to help us defend the city."
 
 mod_municipal_self_defense_reform: "Municipal Self-Defense"
 mod_municipal_self_defense_reform_desc: "Only by relying on the military capabilities of our city state can we ensure our survival. We shall allocate more political power to the captains of the City Watch and ensure that they have all they need to provide for our defense."
 
 mod_broaden_executive_powers_reform: "Broaden Executive Powers"
 mod_broaden_executive_powers_reform_desc: "As the country grows so does the need to be able to act swiftly and efficiently. The only way to ensure this is by broadening the powers of the executive branch so that it has the tools it needs."
 
 mod_devolution_of_powers_reform: "Devolution of Powers"
 mod_devolution_of_powers_reform_desc: "No single person can rule a country as big and complex as ours. Collecting such powers in the hand of one ruler is also contrary to the Republican ideals of our ancestors.\nDecentralization and Devolution is how we can best remain able to dynamically meet the needs of an ever-growing state."

 mod_citizenry_reform: "Citizenry"
 mod_citizenry_reform_desc: "A Republic relies on its citizens to function and so it is only right that each citizen in our state will have the power to vote for who will guide our country. Attaining the privilege of being a citizen will also be a spur for all those under our rule to strive for good conduct."
 
 mod_appointment_by_committee_reform: "Appointment by Committee"

 mod_pious_merchants_reform_desc: "Spreading the one true faith is expensive work, and our merchants have heavy pockets that would prove useful to the faith if we were to elevate these rich men to positions of power within the state."
 
 mod_loyal_nobility_reform: "Divine Nobility"
 mod_loyal_nobility_reform_desc: "There are those in our realm who are born with divine blood; chosen by the holy forces of this world to lead and rule.

 mod_monastic_breweries_reform: "Monastic Breweries"
 mod_monastic_breweries_reform_desc: "In our faith, the consumption of alcohol for the clergy is strictly prohibited. So, many monasteries fill their treasuries with the profits made from brewing wine, mead, and ale."

 mod_theocratic_democracy_reform: "Theocratic Democracy"
 mod_theocratic_democracy_reform_desc: "We are divinest of all, but we must never forget the inherent divinity found in even the lowliest of commoners. By allowing our peasants to elect their own representatives, we allow them to have their own voice in the court of the divine."

 mod_religious_societies_reform: "Religious Society"
 mod_religious_societies_reform_desc: "While clan loyalties can take us far our expansion has made us the masters of more peoples than we once did. A strongly religious society can withstand expansion in both time and space more efficiently and will give us the cohesion we need."
